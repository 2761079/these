@article{CDDMJ08j,
	Abstract = {This article deals with uncertainty and imprecision treatment during the mobile robot localization process. The imprecision determination is based on the use of the interval formalism. Indeed, the mobile robot is equipped with an exteroceptive sensor and odometers. The imprecise data given by these two sensors are fused by constraint propagation on intervals. At the end of the algorithm, we get 3D localization subpaving which is supposed to contain the robot's position in a guaranteed way. Concerning the uncertainty, it is managed through a propagation architecture based on the use of the Transferable Belief Model of Smets. This architecture enables to propagate uncertainty from low level data (sensor data) in order to quantify the global uncertainty of the robot localization estimation. },
